# AWS CloudFormation Sample Templates
This repository contains sample templates launching AWS resources based on scenarios for learning purposes. 

They're not compliant with security standards for production environments.

# About the Repository
## AWS Region
The templates are supposed to work **US-EAST-1** Region, if you're having trouble to launch the stack, either adjust region-specific attributes or change it to **N. Virginia**.

## Structure
Each template has its directory with the template itself and a disclaimer of what it does. Please read it.

## Free Tier
All templates are intended to be free-tier eligible. However, double-check is always a good practice.

Also, it won't map all kinds of instances, regions, AZs, or AMIs, etc.
